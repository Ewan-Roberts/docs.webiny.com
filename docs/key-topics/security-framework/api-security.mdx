:::tip What you'll learn
- how security framework is structured and connected to Webiny
- what are permissions and how authorization works
:::

The security framework is a thin application layer that allows you to handle _authentication_ and _authorization_ using plugins. It is present on both API side, and React side of Webiny apps. Security in Webiny revolves around permissions. Webiny apps, as well as your custom apps, request permissions from the security layer when the code reaches certain points in your business logic and needs to check if current identity is authorized (has permission) to execute certain operations.

## What's an Identity?

An identity is a **verified** piece of information that tells us **who** is using the system (be it API or React app)
. Identity must be determined during the `authentication` phase. If no identity is determined, the system uses 
the `anonymous` identity. 

It is OK _not_ to have an identity. Not every interaction with the system requires authorization; and since 
authorization is performed based on the identity (we assign permissions to an identity), it just means that there 
are scenarios when having identity is not necessary.

## What's a Permission?

A permission tells the system what the `identity` can or cannot do. In case of Webiny, it's a simple object that 
contains a _name_, and additional optional properties that are relevant to the business logic. Permissions are used 
during `authorization`. During request processing, a system can execute authorization many times. Different parts of 
the system will require different permissions.


In the following articles we dive deeper into the API and React side of things and see how these two environments 
are similar but also slightly different at the same time.
