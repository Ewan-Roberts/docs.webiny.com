## Overview
This section covers the main configuration file for the Page Builder theme and all the plugins with which it is consist of.

## Configuration File
The main configuration file for the Page Builder theme is located at: [`apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts).
This file exports a list of Page Builder theme plugins, and that's what you later import in your `website` app and then register as a plugin.

The configuration file is structured in several sections like so:

```ts
[
    // main theme plugin containing the theme definition
    {
        name: "pb-theme-default"            // name of your theme
        type: `pb-theme`                    // plugin type
        theme: {}                           // theme definition
    } as PbThemePlugin,

    // register a layout ... you can register multiple layouts inside a single theme
    {
        name: "pb-page-layout-static"       // name of the page layout
        type: "pb-page-layout",             // plugin type
        layout: {}                          // layout definition
    } as PbPageLayoutPlugin,
    // register a default error page ... you can register your.
    {
        name: "pb-default-page-error",      // name of the default page
        type: "pb-default-page",            // plugin type
        component: DefaultErrorPage         // component definition
    } as PbDefaultPagePlugin,
    // register a default error page ... you can register your.
    {
        name: "pb-default-page-not-found",  // name of the default page
        type: "pb-default-page",            // plugin type
        component: DefaultNotFoundPage      // component definition
    } as PbDefaultPagePlugin
]
```
We are exporting all the plugins needed to make the Page Builder theme.
Here is a short description for each:
- a plugin that holds a theme definition
- a plugin for a layout to render static pages
- a plugin for default error page
- a plugin for default not found (404) page

The reason why we don't "lump" all these elements into a single plugin is because this way you can overwrite just a specific piece of a particular theme with your own plugin, without the need to copy or replace the whole theme.

For example, if you wanted to replace the default error page with your custom component, you could to this:

```ts title="apps/website/code/src/plugins/index.ts"
import { plugins } from "@webiny/plugins";
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity.
import theme from "theme";
// Register all plugins
plugins.register([
  imageComponent(),
  pageBuilder,
  formBuilder,
  theme(),
  // Your custom error page plugin
  {
    name: "pb-default-page-error",
    type: "pb-default-page",
    component: MyCustomErrorPage
  } as PbDefaultPagePlugin
]);

```
