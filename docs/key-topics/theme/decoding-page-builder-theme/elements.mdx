## Overview

Another way Webiny Page Builder ensures that visual styles follow your design system is by having certain style presets for some of the elements like the Button element as shown below:

<!-- vale off -->

<img
  src={require("./images/webiny-theme-elements.gif").default}
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Webiny theme elements"
/>

<!-- vale on -->

## Elements Definition

Elements are defined in the `elements` section of the [`pb-theme`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-theme) plugin.
It defines certain attributes for Page Builder elements that you can insert into your page content.
For example:

```json title="apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts"
{
  "elements": {
    "button": {
      "types": [
        { "className": "", "label": "Default" },
        { "className": "primary", "label": "Primary" },
        { "className": "secondary", "label": "Secondary" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The only element that supports this at the moment is the `Button` element. But the point is that if you create a custom component for Page Builder, you can reference the same mechanism and add this functionality to your custom elements.

The definition takes two keys:

- `className`: Name of the `CSS` class that gets appended to that element.
- `label`: This is what's shown in the dropdown when a user is selecting a style.

  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Webiny theme elements"
/>
