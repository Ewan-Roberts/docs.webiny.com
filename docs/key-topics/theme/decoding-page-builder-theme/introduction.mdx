- what plugins are used in Page Builder theme
  :::

## Overview

This section covers the main configuration file for the Page Builder theme and all the plugins with which it is consist of.

## Configuration File

The main configuration file for the Page Builder theme is located at: [`apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts).
This file exports a list of Page Builder theme plugins, and that's what you later import in your `website` app and then register as a plugin.

The configuration file is structured in several sections like so:

```ts
[
    // main theme plugin containing the theme definition
    {
        name: "pb-theme-default"            // name of your theme
        type: `pb-theme`                    // plugin type
        theme: {}                           // theme definition
    } as PbThemePlugin,

    // register a layout ... you can register multiple layouts inside a single theme
    {
        name: "pb-page-layout-static"       // name of the page layout
        type: "pb-page-layout",             // plugin type
        layout: {}                          // layout definition
    } as PbPageLayoutPlugin
]
```

As you can see from the example above, we export two plugins that makes the default Page Builder theme.
Let's discuss them in detail in the next section.

## Page Builder Theme Plugins

### [`pb-theme`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-theme) plugin

This is the plugin that registers the actual theme, together with several other elements.
In full a `pb-theme` plugin contains the following elements:

```ts
{
        name: "pb-theme-default",
        type: "pb-theme",
        theme: {
            colors: {
                primary: "var(--webiny-theme-color-primary)",
                secondary: "var(--webiny-theme-color-secondary)",
                //...
            },
            elements: {
                button: {
                    types: [
                        { className: "", label: "Default" },
                        { className: "primary", label: "Primary" },
                        //..
                    ]
                }
            },
            typography: {
                h1: {
                    label: "Heading 1",
                    component: "h1",
                    className: "webiny-pb-typography-h1"
                },
                h2: {
                    label: "Heading 2",
                    component: "h2",
                    className: "webiny-pb-typography-h2"
                },
                //...
            }
        }
    } as PbThemePlugin
```

### [`pb-page-layout`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-page-layout) plugin

The layout plugin is used to register layouts. Layouts are used to render the page content.
Here is an example of how to register a layout:

```ts
import StaticLayout from "./layouts/Static";
//...
{
    name: "pb-page-layout-static",
    type: "pb-page-layout",
    layout: {
        name: "static",
        title: "Static page",
        component: StaticLayout
    }
} as PbPageLayoutPlugin
```

Each layout has the following attributes:

- `name` - internal identifier for that particular layout
- `type` - plugin type, must be set to `pb-page-layout`
- `layout` - an object containing the layout `name`, `title` and a React `component` used to render the layout

To introduce multiple layouts all you need to do is register multiple `pb-page-layout` plugins.
It's also quite easy to register a new layout into the default theme:

```js title="apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts"
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity.
import CustomLayout from "../custom-layout";

plugins.register([
  //..
  {
    name: "pb-page-layout-my-custom-layout",
    type: "pb-page-layout",
    layout: {
      name: "my-custom-layout",
      title: "My layout",
      component: CustomLayout
    }
  }
  //..
]);
```

After saving the change, your newly registered layout appear in the app as shown below:

<!-- vale off -->

<img
  src={require("../../assets/theme/theme__custom-layout.gif").default}
  className="no-shadow"
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="New custom layout"
/>

<!-- vale on -->

To learn more about layouts and how to compose one, have a look at the [layouts page](/docs/webiny-apps/page-builder/development/themes/layouts).
