## Overview

The colors used throughout the theme and Page Builder pages are extracted as variables and presented as color presets in the page editor.

This ensure a visual consistency between the theme and users creating content.

## Color Definition

Colors are defined in the `color` section of the [`pb-theme`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-theme) plugin.
As a general practice, don't define `HEX` or `RGB` colors directly, but reference them as a `CSS` variable, like the following example:

```json title="apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts"
{
  "colors": {
    "primary": "var(--webiny-theme-color-primary)",
    "secondary": "var(--webiny-theme-color-secondary)",
    "background": "var(--webiny-theme-color-background)",
    "surface": "var(--webiny-theme-color-surface)",
    "textPrimary": "var(--webiny-theme-color-text-primary)"
  }
}
```

:::info
Defining them as `CSS` variable is important because when you select a color in the Page Builder editor for a certain element property, be that:

- `background-color`
- `border-color`
- `shadow`

the value of the color is stored in the database.

In case of `CSS` variables, the `CSS` variable is stored, meaning that if you later decide to change the value of that color, you just change it in your CSS file, and all the existing content will pick up the new value.
On the other hand, if we stored `HEX` or `RGB` values, all the existing content will not pick up the new value.
