## Overview

In this section, you learn all about the Webiny theme and its basic concepts. You get all the knowledge needed to create your own theme.

Styling is one of the more important tasks you might want to do on a website. The theme passes on the visual identity of your brand and ensures a uniform presentation across all the channels.

Webiny apps, like `Page Builder` and `Form Builder`, support themes and layouts to control the visual presentation of your content. These are implemented as plugins in the [`theme`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/apps/theme) package.

There are a few main things you need to understand about Webiny themes. This article will cover these basics concepts.

## There isn't a Single Theme

Webiny doesn't have a concept of a "global" theme that is shared across all applications. Each application, or in some cases even plugins, can register their own theme.

With this approach each time you install a new app or a plugin, it automatically comes with all the visuals and layouts you need to start using it immediately.

You have to understand that Webiny is not your basic blogging platform, Webiny is a serverless application framework upon which powerful serverless applications can be built. Those applications might have complex theme requirements. So instead of you going through dozens of files and pasting numerous code snippets in your existing theme, just to get the new app working, this one-theme-per-app concept removes that complexity since every app automatically ships with its own theme package.

As a benefit, each time you update Webiny, or one of its apps or, plugins, you don't need to go through a nerve-racking, nail-biting process of "hoping" that your website will work after the update.
Because each app update automatically updates the theme just for that app you don't need to worry that there will be incompatibilities between apps on the theme side which cause the website to break.

## Registering a Theme

Each `theme` in Webiny is also a plugin in itself. This means you register it as any other plugin in your apps.

If you open [`apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts#L13), in your Webiny project, you notice that we `import` the `theme` from its own package, and then register it as a plugin as shown below:

```ts
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity.
import theme from "theme";

plugins.register = [
  /**
   * App theme controls page builder and form builder layouts, styles, etc.
   */
  theme()
  //..
];
//..
```

That's all it takes to register a theme. The same principle applies if you want to register your own theme.

Creating and registering a new theme is just a question of creating a new package and replacing the existing theme plugin with your own. We'll cover in greater detail how this plugin should look like and what it should contain.
