## Overview

In this section, you learn all about the Form Builder theme layouts.

Every form you create via the Form Builder app has a layout, which lets you define the design of your forms.

Because the form layout is a React component, there are virtually no restrictions when it comes to adding customizations.
Feel free to organize the code to your liking, import custom CSS, fonts, or even additional custom React components if there's a need for it.

## Using Layout in Forms
Be default, every form has a default layout, which can be changed via the form settings. In the form builder, click on the settings icon in the top right corner:

<!-- vale off -->

<img
  src={require("./images/webiny-fb-form-settings-button.png").default}
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Webiny form settings button"
/>

<!-- vale on -->

You should then see the following screen, and the "Layout" field at the bottom of the general settings form:

<!-- vale off -->

<img
  src={require("./images/webiny-fb-form-settings.png").default}
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Webiny form settings button"
/>

<!-- vale on -->

:::note
Please note that a single form layout can be used on any number of forms, but every single form can use only one layout.

## Add a New Form Layout

You can add a new form layout in the Form Builder app in these two simple steps:
1. create a React component which contains all the logic related to the layout
2. then, register it as a [`form-layout`](/docs/references/form-builder/plugins) plugin


### Plugin

The following snippet of code shows how to add a new form layout via a simple plugin:

```ts title="apps/theme/formBuilder/index.ts"
import DefaultFormLayout from "./layouts/DefaultFormLayout";

export default [
  {
    name: "form-layout-default",
    type: "form-layout",
    layout: {
      name: "default",
      title: "Default layout",
      component: DefaultFormLayout
    }
  }
];
```

:::note
The plugin is defined once, but must be registered both in your admin and website apps.
It enables you to do both:
- see the form preview in the Form Builder editor
- and show your form on the actual website
:::


:::info
The Form Builder theme is located in [`apps/theme`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/theme/formBuilder/index.ts) package
and is registered in both [`apps/admin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts#L59)
and [`apps/admin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/website/code/src/plugins/index.ts#L6)
:::

The following table shows a list of all keys and values that the plugin must define:

| Key         | Value Type        | Description                                                                                                  |
| :---------- | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | `string`          | Unique plugin name.                                                                                          |
| `type`      | `string`          | Plugin type, must equal to `form-layout`.                                                                    |
| `layout`     | `Object`          | Object containing a unique `name` for the theme, a human readable `title` and a reference to the actual React `component` that will be used to render the form. |


### Form Layout React Component

To get a better feeling of what's expected of a single form layout component, you can check out the default layout component, located at:
[`apps/theme/formBuilder/layouts/DefaultFormLayout.tsx`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/theme/formBuilder/layouts/DefaultFormLayout.tsx)

If needed, feel free to edit the file to your liking, or just create a copy and, use that as a foundation for a new form layout.
