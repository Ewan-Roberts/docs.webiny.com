## Overview

This section covers the main configuration file for the Page Builder theme and all the plugins with which it is consists.
The goal of this article is to help you get familiar with the Page Builder theme, so that, you can customize it as per your need.

## Configuration File

The main configuration file for the Page Builder theme is located at: [`apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/apps/theme/pageBuilder/index.ts).
This file exports a list of Page Builder theme plugins, and that's what you later import in your `website` app and then register as a plugin.

The configuration file is structured in several sections like so:

```ts
[
    // main theme plugin containing the theme definition
    {
        name: "pb-theme-default"            // name of your theme
        type: `pb-theme`                    // plugin type
        theme: {}                           // theme definition
    } as PbThemePlugin,

    // register a layout ... you can register multiple layouts inside a single theme
    {
        name: "pb-page-layout-static"       // name of the page layout
        type: "pb-page-layout",             // plugin type
        layout: {}                          // layout definition
    } as PbPageLayoutPlugin
]
```

As you can see from the example above, we export two plugins that make the default Page Builder theme.
Let's discuss them in detail in the next section.

## Page Builder Theme Plugins

### [`pb-theme`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-theme) plugin

This is the plugin that registers the actual theme, together with several other elements.
In full a `pb-theme` plugin contains the following elements:

```ts
{
        name: "pb-theme-default",
        type: "pb-theme",
        theme: {
            colors: {
                primary: "var(--webiny-theme-color-primary)",
                secondary: "var(--webiny-theme-color-secondary)",
                //...
            },
            elements: {
                button: {
                    types: [
                        { className: "", label: "Default" },
                        { className: "primary", label: "Primary" },
                        //..
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    } as PbThemePlugin
```

### [`pb-page-layout`](/docs/references/page-builder/plugins#pb-page-layout) plugin

The layout plugin is used to register layouts. Layouts are used to render the page content.
Here is an example of how to register a layout:

```ts
import StaticLayout from "./layouts/Static";
//...
{
    name: "pb-page-layout-static",
    type: "pb-page-layout",
    layout: {
        name: "static",
        title: "Static page",
        component: StaticLayout
    }
} as PbPageLayoutPlugin
```

Each layout has the following attributes:

- `name` - an internal identifier for that particular layout
- `type` - plugin type, must be set to `pb-page-layout`
- `layout` - an object containing the layout `name`, `title`, and a React `component` used to render the layout

To introduce multiple layouts all you need to do is register multiple `pb-page-layout` plugins.
It's also quite easy to register a new layout into the default theme:

```js title="apps/admin/code/src/plugins/index.ts"
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity.
import CustomLayout from "../custom-layout";

plugins.register([
  //..
  {
    name: "pb-page-layout-my-custom-layout",
    type: "pb-page-layout",
    layout: {
      name: "my-custom-layout",
      title: "My layout",
      component: CustomLayout
    }
  }
  //..
]);
```

After saving the change, your newly registered layout appear in the app as shown below:

<!-- vale off -->

<img
  src={require("../../assets/theme/theme__custom-layout.gif").default}
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="New custom layout"
/>

<!-- vale on -->
