## Development

### Admin Area React Application - Reduced Deployment Time ([#1740](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1740))

Prior to this release, every time we'd deploy the Admin Area project application and its React application, all of the production build files (JS, CSS, images) would be re-uploaded from scratch. This would happen even in cases where there are no changes between the files.

From now on, files whose content didn't change simply won't be uploaded. This will significantly speed up the deployment of the Admin Area project application.


### Improved Existing Scaffolds ([#1739](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1739))

A couple of minor fixes and improvements were made to the [scaffolding utilities](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/introduction), introduced in the previous [Webiny 5.9.0](/docs/changelog/5.9.0) release.

Maybe the most significant change would be the default path, in which the application code will be generated. For example, when running the [Extend GraphQL API](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/extend-graphql-api), we've changed the `api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/graphql` to `api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds`. So, we've decided to remove the trailing `graphql` folder, simply because we've noticed it's unnecessary.
