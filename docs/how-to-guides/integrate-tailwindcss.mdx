- how to integrate Tailwind CSS in your Webiny project
:::

## Overview

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a popular utility-first CSS framework.
So, naturally, one of the most frequently asked questions by the community is **how to add tailwindcss in Webiny project?**
And, in this guide, we'll answer exactly that. So without further ado let's start.

:::info
The code that we will cover in this guide can also be found in our GitHub [examples repository](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/integrate-tailwind-css).
:::

## Prerequisites

**A Webiny Project**

This tutorial assumes you have already created a new Webiny project to work on.
We recommend reading our [install Webiny](/docs/tutorials/install-webiny) tutorial which shows you how to do it.

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind via Yarn
Install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using yarn by running the following command from root of your project:

```
yarn add -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat^2.1.2 postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

Webiny currently uses [Webpack 4](https://v4.webpack.js.org/) which doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet so you need to install the [Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7 compatibility](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) build for now as shown above.

### Add Tailwindcss to Webpack Configuration

We need to add the `tailwindcss` to the `postcss` plugins inside the webpack configuration of the application.
In this guide, we integrate `tailwindcss` in the **Website** `(apps/website)` application.
But, you can use the same approach for other Webiny applications or a custom application for that matter.

Every Webiny application has a `webiny.config.js` file that exports the commands for processing the application.
In the case of **Website**`(apps/website)` it contains the following commands:
- `start` to start the application
- `build` to build the application

Let's take a brief look at the file content:

```js title="apps/website/code/webiny.config.js"
const { startApp, buildApp } = require("@webiny/project-utils");
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity

module.exports = {
    commands: {
        async start(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Start local development
            await startApp(options, context);
        },
        async build(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Bundle app for deployment
            await buildApp(options, context);
        }
    }
};
```
As you can see in the above file, we export an object with `commands.start` and `commands.build` functions.

We use `startApp` and `buildApp` helper functions that we imported from `"@webiny/project-utils"` in `commands.start` and `commands.build` respectively.

Both, `startApp` and `buildApp` function, takes two arguments: `options` and `context`.

You can pass a function named `webpack` to this `options` object. It receives `config` as the single argument and should return the new config for webpack.
We will make use of this function to add `tailwindcss` support in our webpack configuration.

Let's see how:
```js title="apps/website/code/webiny.config.js {10-15,23-28}"
const { startApp, buildApp } = require("@webiny/project-utils");
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity

module.exports = {
    commands: {
        async start(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Start local development
            await startApp(
                {
                    ...options,
                    webpack(config) {
                        return require("./applyTailwindToWebpack")(config);
                    }
                },
                context
            );
        },
        async build(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Bundle app for deployment
            await buildApp(
                {
                    ...options,
                    webpack(config) {
                        return require("./applyTailwindToWebpack")(config);
                    }
                },
                context
            );
        }
    }
};
```

We use `options.webpack` to apply tailwindcss to webpack in both `startApp` and `buildApp`.

:::info
We made this change in both `startApp` and `buildApp` so that we can use `tailwindcss` in both local development and deployed application.
:::

The actual code responsible for making the required modifications to the webpack configuration is inside the `applyTailwindToWebpack` file.

Let's take a look at the content of `applyTailwindToWebpack` file:

```js title="apps/website/code/applyTailwindToWebpack.js"
const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
const { traverseLoaders } = require("@webiny/project-utils");

/**
 * A helper function to modify webpack config
 */
module.exports = config => {
    /**
     * Traverse all loaders, find `postcss-loader`, and overwrite plugins.
     */
    traverseLoaders(config.module.rules, loader => {
        // `loader` can also be a string, so check for `.loader` property
        if (loader.loader && loader.loader.includes("postcss-loader")) {
            loader.options.plugins = [...loader.options.plugins(), tailwindcss()];
        }
    });

    return config;
};
```

Here we export a helper function that modifies webpack configuration.
It takes `config` as the single argument and returns the new configuration after making some modifications to it.

Inside that function, we use `traverseLoaders` helper function that we `require` from `"@webiny/project-utils"` package.
It traverses all the loaders defined in `modules.rules` property of the webpack configuration and passes each one of them to your callback.
You can then apply your modifications. In our case, we add tailwind plugins to the `postcss-loader`.

Now that we have added `tailwindcss` to webpack configuration, let's move on to the next step.

### Create Your Tailwindcss Configuration File
Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` file. From the root of your project run the following command:

```
tailwindcss init
```

:::note
We have created the `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of Webiny project so that we can share it across all Webiny applications,
for example, `(apps/admin)` and `(apps/website)`.
:::

This creates a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

:::info
Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).
:::

Now that we have this global configuration, let's use it in the **Website** `(apps/website)` application as shown below:

```js title="apps/website/code/tailwind.config.js"
// Import config from the project root
module.exports = require("../../../tailwind.config");
```

### Include Tailwind in Your SCSS
Now it's time to include the tailwind directives in your styles.
As most of the styles for Webiny applications are present in `(apps/theme)`, we also include tailwind styles there.

Open the `apps/theme/styles.scss` file that exports all theme styles and use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles as shown below:

```scss title="apps/theme/styles.scss"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
(...)
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.


That's all! Now, when you start your **Website** `(apps/website)` application locally, by running:

```
yarn start --env=local
```

or build it (which happens automatically for you when you deploy your application using `webiny deploy` command)

```
yarn build --env=<YOUR_ENV>
```
Tailwind CSS is ready to use in your Webiny project.

### Use Tailwind in Website

Now, you're all set to use the tailwind CSS in your **Website** `(apps/website)`, let's try adding an example section made with tailwindcss as shown below:

```tsx title="apps/website/code/src/ExampleMadeWithTailwindCSS.tsx"
import React from "react";

const ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS = () => {
    return (
        <div className="mt-12 -mb-12 bg-gray-50">
            <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:py-16 lg:px-8 lg:flex lg:items-center lg:justify-between">
                <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-4xl">
                    <span className="block">Ready to dive in?</span>
                    <span className="block text-purple-600">Start your free trial today.</span>
                </h2>
                <div className="mt-8 flex lg:mt-0 lg:flex-shrink-0">
                    <div className="inline-flex rounded-md shadow">
                        <a
                            href="#"
                            className="inline-flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700"
                        >
                            Get started
                        </a>
                    </div>
                    <div className="ml-3 inline-flex rounded-md shadow">
                        <a
                            href="#"
                            className="inline-flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-md text-purple-600 bg-white hover:bg-indigo-50"
                        >
                            Learn more
                        </a>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}

export default ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS;
```
For demonstration purpose, let's add this example component to the `App.tsx` file as shown below:

```tsx title="apps/website/code/src/App.tsx" {3,9}
import React from "react";
(...)
import ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS from "./ExampleMadeWithTailwindCSS";

export const App = () => (
    <ApolloProvider client={createApolloClient()}>
        <BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}>
            <PageBuilderProvider>
                <ExampleMadeWithTailiwindCSS />
                <Switch>
                    <Route path={"*"} component={Page} />
                </Switch>
            </PageBuilderProvider>
        </BrowserRouter>
    </ApolloProvider>
);

```

And, this is how it looks in the browser:

<img
  src={require("./assets/integrate-tailwindcss/tailwind-css-demo-website.png").default}
  style={{ marginBottom: 20 }}
  alt="Website demo using tailwindcss"
