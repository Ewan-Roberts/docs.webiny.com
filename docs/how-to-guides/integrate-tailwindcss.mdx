:::tip What you'll learn

- how to install Tailwind CSS in your Webiny project
:::

## Overview

[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a popular utility-first CSS framework.
One of the most frequently asked question is **how to add tailwindcss in Webiny project?** in this guide we'll answer exactly that.
So without further ado let's start.

The code that we will cover in this guide can also be found in our GitHub [examples repository](#).

## Prerequisites

**A Webiny Project**

This tutorial assumes you have already created a new Webiny project to work on.
We recommend reading our [install Webiny](/docs/tutorials/install-webiny) tutorial which shows you how to do it.

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS

### Install Tailwind via Yarn
Install Tailwind and its peer-dependencies using yarn:

```
yarn add -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat^2.1.2 postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9
```

Webiny currently uses [Webpack 4](https://v4.webpack.js.org/) which doesn't support PostCSS 8 yet so you need to install the [Tailwind CSS v2.0 PostCSS 7 compatibility](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#post-css-7-compatibility-build) build for now as shown above.

### Add Tailwindcss to Webpack Configuration

We need to add the `tailwindcss` to the `postcss` plugins inside the webpack configuration. Let's see how:

Every Webiny application has a `webiny.config.js` file which exports the commands for processing the application.
In case of **Website**`(apps/website)` it contains following commands:
- start to start the app
- build to build the app

Let's take a look at:

```js title="apps/website/code/webiny.config.js"
const { startApp, buildApp } = require("@webiny/project-utils");
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity

module.exports = {
    commands: {
        async start(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Start local development
            await startApp(options, context);
        },
        async build(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Bundle app for deployment
            await buildApp(options, context);
        }
    }
};
```
<!-- TODO: Add a bit more detial about why we need to change it in to places. -->
<!-- TODO: Also explain what is the webpack in options. -->
Both `startApp` and `buildApp` functions `options` argument contains the webpack configuration which we will update to support tailwindcss.

Let's see how:
```js title="apps/website/code/webiny.config.js {10-15,23-28}"
const { startApp, buildApp } = require("@webiny/project-utils");
// Some code is removed for the sake of brevity

module.exports = {
    commands: {
        async start(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Start local development
            await startApp(
                {
                    ...options,
                    webpack(config) {
                        return require("./applyTailwindToWebpack")(config);
                    }
                },
                context
            );
        },
        async build(options, context) {
            (...)
            // Bundle app for deployment
            await buildApp(
                {
                    ...options,
                    webpack(config) {
                        return require("./applyTailwindToWebpack")(config);
                    }
                },
                context
            );
        }
    }
};
```

As you can see from the code example above. We use `options.webpack` to apply tailwindcss to webpack in both `startApp` and `buildApp`.
Now, let's take a look at what does `applyTailwindToWebpack` do?

```js title="apps/website/code/applyTailwindToWebpack.js"
const tailwindcss = require("tailwindcss");
const { traverseLoaders } = require("@webiny/project-utils");

/**
 * A helper function to modify webpack config
 */
module.exports = config => {
    /**
     * Traverse all loaders, find `postcss-loader`, and overwrite plugins.
     */
    traverseLoaders(config.module.rules, loader => {
        // `loader` can also be a string, so check for `.loader` property
        if (loader.loader && loader.loader.includes("postcss-loader")) {
            loader.options.plugins = [...loader.options.plugins(), tailwindcss()];
        }
    });

    return config;
};
```

Here we `exports` a helper function to modify webpack configuration. It takes `config` as an argument and returns it after making some modifications to it.

Inside that function we use `traverseLoaders` helper function that we imported from `"@webiny/project-utils"` package.
It traverse all the loaders defined in `modules.rules` property of the webpack configuration. And then for loaders that include `"postcss-loader"` we push `tailwindcss` to its plugins.
Phew!.

Now that we have add `tailwindcss` to webpack config. Let's move on the next step.

### Create Your Tailwindcss Configuration File
Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` file. From the root of your project run the following command:

```
tailwindcss init
```

:::note
We have created the `tailwind.config.js` file in the root of Webiny project because this way we can share it across all Webiny applications,
for example, `(app/admin)` and `(apps/website)`.
:::

This creates a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js title="tailwind.config.js"
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

:::info
Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).
:::

Now we use this root level configuration in the **Website** `(apps/website)` application as shown below:

```js title="apps/website/code/tailwind.config.js"
// Import config from the project root
module.exports = require("../../../tailwind.config");
```

### Include Tailwind in Your CSS
Open the `apps/theme/styles.scss` file that contains all theme styles and use the `@tailwind` directive to include Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles:

```scss title="apps/theme/styles.scss"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
(...)
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build-time with all of the styles it generates based on your configured design system.



You're finished! Now when you start your **Website** `(apps/website)` application locally by running

```
yarn start --env=local
```

or build it (which happens automatically for you when you deploy your application using `webiny deploy` command)

```
yarn build --env=<YOUR_ENV>
```
Tailwind CSS is ready to use in your Webiny project.
